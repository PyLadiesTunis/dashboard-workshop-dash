    "\n",
    "In this workshop we will explore key characteristics of the housing market in Vancouver, BC. \n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to note that this workshop assumes:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Data cleaning and exploration was completed prior to developing the dashboard\n",
    "2. Some comfort with `pandas` and visualization is assumed\n",
    "3. Comfort navigating the Jupyter environment is needed\n",
    "\n",
    "### Workshop schedule:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Part I: Data exploration\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, we will first spend time getting familiar with the data. We will use the `pandas` and `plotly` libraries, we will also explore the `DEX` feature within Noteable to ease getting a good sense for what the data contains.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, we will also explore the notion of factoring code into functions, and the notion of writing a Python script that we can use to easily recreate our results. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Part II: Dashboard components\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, we will take what we built together in part I and explore the main components in a Dash dashboard. "
