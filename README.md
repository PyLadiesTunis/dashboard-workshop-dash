# Vancouver DataJam Workshop: Create your first dashboard using Dash and Plotly

### Workshop level: intermediate

### Background knowledge

Knowledge of working with pandas needed to engage with the material in this workshop. Knowledge of function definition assumed. Recommended to be familiar with at least one visualizing library in Python. Working knowledge of plotly is a plus, but not necessary. Knowledge of HTML is not necessary. 

### Workshop description

In this workshop we will use pandas, plotly and Dash to create a dashboard that explores changes in the average housing price for the last 5 years. In this workshop, we will start
by generating visualizations that are eye catching and interactive using plotly. We will then work together to bring our functions into a script. Participants will be introduced into dashboarding, layout options, and will work together to generate and test a local dashboard. Participants will learn how to deploy their dashboard to production. 

### Workshop schedule

1. Data exploration and visualization using Jupyter notebooks
2. Turning code into functions, and scripting
3. Introduction to Dash and layouts 
4. Designing our layout
5. Implement dashboard and test locally
6. Engineering check: files necessary to successfully deploy 
7. Hosting the dashboard
